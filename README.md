## Color Guess
Bonus project (*not mandatory*) developed during block 05, in which I studied the _DOM tree, events, and JavaScript storage_.

![how the color guess project works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99998543/160259283-736bb752-a097-4097-8ed5-6d3e04c51029.gif)

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. The game will generate a code _rgb_ (red, green, and blue), and from that, the user must select the color corresponding to this code;
2. If the player gets it right, ___3 points___ will be added to their score, and, once the page is updated, the score is ___zero___;
3. To continue playing, press the `Generate new game` button.
